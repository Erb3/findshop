## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please do **not** create a GitHub issue, but report a [security vulnerability on GitHub Security instead!](https://github.com/Pixium/FindShop/security/advisories).
This lets the maintainers get aware of the vulnerability, and talk with the security researcher in private.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you believe you found a security vulnerability, please do not talk about it in public!
