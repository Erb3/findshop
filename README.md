# FindShop

FindShop is a SwitchCraft service providing an easy way to search for compatible shops implementing the [ShopSync] protocol.
Valid command aliases are `\fs`, `\find` or `\findshop`.

## FAQ

### Why are shops or items missing?

There are a few reasons why your search results may not be what you expected, such as the following.

#### The search term may be too specific or misspelled

FindShop matches results based on exact matches to an item name (display name and item id). So, for example, if you were searching for slime blocks (`minecraft:slime_block`):

- `slime` would be matched to both the display name ("**Slime** Block") and the item ID (minecraft:**slime**\_block)
- `slime_block` would be matched to the item ID (minecraft:**slime_block**)
- `slimeblock` would return **NOTHING** because the display name has a space in between "slime" and "block" and the item ID replaces this space with an underscore.

#### FindShop doesn't have the shop

FindShop fetches shop information, including location, pricing & stock, from shops implementing the [ShopSync] standard.
Shops might not appear if:

- their software doesn't support ShopSync
- their software implemented ShopSync incorrectly
- their shop hasn't been configured to use ShopSync
- their shop hasn't been loaded recently

## Deployment

You must use a reverse-proxy like [NginX](https://nginx.org/) or [Casket](https://docs.casketserver.com/) to rate-limit, log and protect the API. The IP of the user must be set to the `X-Forwarded-For` header. The proxy must not accept any pre-existing value in the header, and should always overwrite it.
